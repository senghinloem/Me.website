        <b>Lorem Ipsum </b> simply dummy text of the printing and 
        typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's 
        standard dummy text ever since the <i>1500s</i>, when an unknown
        printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a ty
        pe specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,
        but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially 
        unchanged. <br> It was popularised in the <mark>1960s</mark> with the release of Letraset
        sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop 
        publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
